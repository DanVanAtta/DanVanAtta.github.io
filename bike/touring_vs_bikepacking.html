<h1>Touring vs BikePacking, differences and definition</h1>

<p>
I've wondered a good bit about exactly what's the difference between the two, and have used the two interchangeably, along with bike-camping.
</p>

<p>
One definition I heard is bikepacking is when you are on tour and go somewhere where cars cannot.
</p>

<p>
My take on the difference is bikepacking is from the MTB community, it's when you put camping gear on a MTB and do a mult-day MTB ride. Generally, I find the MTB community avoids areas that have car-traffic.
</p>

<h2>Gravel riding, touring or bikepacking?</h2>

<p>
Gravel riding is almost new to the bike community in some ways, a bit of a third category that has gotten popular in the last few years (circa 2016+). I'd consider gravel heavy routes to still be a tour.
</p> 

<h2>Which should I do, a tour or bikepacking?</h2>

<p>
Depends on the kind of riding you like to do. Most bikepacking routes I find I'd actually consider to be tours. If you've got a route that needs a MTB, and you like that kind of riding, and have done MTB riding before, and are generally car-phobic, then I'd say go with a bikepacking trip. Really, to each their own, both have their fine qualities.
</p>

<h2> What makes for a good bikepacking trip, and for a good tour?</h2>

<p>
Isolated places that have low to no car traffic I've found to be the most pleasant. For me it's the intense noise and pollution of vehicle traffic that ruins it. While the safety concern at times is a concern for me, I'm generally comfortable listening for traffic and trying to work with people to share the road and ensure I can be passed safely.
</p>

<p>
Beyond a good route, knowing what you want out of your ride I think are most important for having a good experience. If you want to test yourself, then choose a more difficult route, if wanting to cruise and spend time on bike, and time at camp, then plan for shorter days.
