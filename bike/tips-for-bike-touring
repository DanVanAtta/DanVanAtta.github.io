# Tips for Bike Touring

## Gear
- The amount of gear you need for an overnighter is almost as much for a longer trip. The only difference is you'll have more patches (more repair kit), maybe
some more clothes. The amount of food you bring will depend on how far apart re-supply is.  If you can get food from stores every 40 miles, you won't need very
much.


## Water / Hydration
- Most water filter systems come with a dirty bag and clean bag. If the hosing from your filter can connect directly to your water bottles or water bladder,
  you won't need the clean bag.
- Water filters clog very easily. Bring a water syringe to flush out water filters. 
- Do not leave water in your filter after using, always suck the remaining water out of your filter and try to blow any debris out after each use.
- On warm & hot days, fill your water bladder or bottles with mostly ice and then water at gas stations
- Avoid paying for water, most gas stations have water for free at the soda fountain or a faucet, ask if you don't see one.
- Body Armour is good stuff


## Food / Nutrition

- Half and half is an excellent source of calories. If doing long distance, a pint of a half and half every 50 miles will help you from losing too much weight.
- Peanut butter is your friend. Always have some, it's hard to bring enough calories otheriwse.
- It's better to have too much water than it is too much food (bring peanut butter).
- Beans are excellent nutrition, at Mexican restaurants always order an extra side of beans
- You want mostly fat calories and something sweet for every now and then to reward yourself and fight off bonk.
- Dried apricots, dried figs, and dates are great road food
- Eat fresh vegetables at least once very two days, you'll want/need the fiber
- Eating the same thing will get old pretty quickly, picking some food up at grocery stores and getting food at restaurants will really help


## Bonking

- Know what you feel like when starting to bonk, when you get there and/or before, force yourself to eat a little something and drink some water,
stay ahead of bonks.


## Sun & Dirt protection

- Cover your skin, you'll avoid sunburn and won't need to apply as much sunblock. You'll also stay much cleaner and can then just strip off and sleep (somewhat)
clean. Find some good material that wicks and evaporatest sweat, it'll be nearly as cool as bare skin. Generally sun is going to be your biggest enemy and you
want to avoid direct skin exposure to sun.
- Stay ahead of sun-burn, apply sunblock really often
- Work in sunblock really well. It works better and won't stick to dirt as much.


## Time Efficiency

You won't have a lot of time, you'll need to be efficient. Your day will consist of: riding, setting up camp, taking down camp, cleaning your bike, 
looking at maps, resting, eating and sleeping.

- Order food to-go at restaurants, it saves time waiting after you're done eating to pay. While waiting for your food, you can clean your drive-train,
  do some routing, and then when you get your food you can eat it and then go.
- Brush your teeth on bike while riding if you can (Sounds kinda crazy). You lose a *lot* of distance with time stopped compared to be moving, moving
slowly is better than not moving and then moving more quickly.


## Resting & Pacing

- Plan to take a rest day every 4 to 5 days. A rest day will be something like 10-30 miles, just a very short day.
- Sleep extra and eat well when you feel more and more tired
- Pay attention to your pulse when you wake up. If you feel your pulse is elevated then you are overtraining and working harder than your body can
easily sustain. Plan to take it easier and/or a rest day soon.

## Organization

- Group items by theme of when you use them. Items you use when camping shoudl be together, items used when riding should be together. Think of it as rooms
in your house, your 'bedroom' should be one or two bags with sleeping bag, pad, tent and any clothes you would wear only for sleeping. Your kitchen
should have your cooking kit and food you'll eat when cooking. Your snack drawer should have snacks easily accessible while riding to eat while riding. Your
garage should have all your repair tools.
- You will need bug spray while riding, mosquitos and horse flies can & will chase you and they can fly fast and far to keep up with you.


## Saddle Sores

- Know how saddle sores are caused, they are generally either from friction or bacterial
- Always clean your shorts/chamois each night by thowing a little soap and water on them to knock off the salt.
- You can put a wet chamois under your thighs at night to help dry them out for the morning
- Chamois butter or chamois cream is pretty useful, it helps disinfect and reduce chafing
- Soap and/or rubbing alcohol applied to the folds your butt when done riding is a good idea to reduce bacteria build up
- Desitin is one of the few things to help heal alleviate saddle sores once you get them, otherwise they do not go away easily.
- Your butt is not bruised, you're probably getting saddle sores


## Routing

- Always plan for ways where you can shorten your route. You never know when you'll wind up fixing your bike for many hours and get behind.
- Don't plan too many miles. You want to enjoy and not just spend all day riding as much as you can. The awesome views you'll pass, you'll want some
time to stop and enjoy them.
- It's not about the miles
- Beware of bike directions from google maps and similar, "roads" can be anything from perfect pavement to narrow ATV trails that would be hard to even walk on
- Plan for where you can get supply and ow


## Clothing

- You need riding clothing and any extra clothing to sleep in, no more. Try to double up as much of that clothing as possible.
- If you can't wear something riding, it'll be less useful, try to have all your camp clothes also be something you would wear while riding
- Rain gear can help keep you warm to sleep in
