<h1>Mistakes when touring</h1>

This list is from personal experience.


<h2>Bad Route</h2>

<p>
Spend some dedicated time really going over your route. A route with gnarly rush-hour traffic will not be fun and can feel or be really dangerous.
</p>

<p>
When designing a long-distance route, be sure there are some 'shortcuts' so you can cut the distance mid-trip if things go slow. You could easily have an unexpected repair day, or a day where you're too tired to ride as far or as much as you thought.
</p>

<h2>Planning too many miles</h2>
<p>
Touring is not about miles, it's about seeking what you want out of a bike adventure. It's easy to make a route longer. Giving slack lets you detour and explore interesting side roads, spend time resting at scenic views, taking the extra time to go see a lighthouse. If the route has too many miles, then you're blowing past everything and just seeking time on bike and miles.
</p>

<h2>Crashing</h2>
<p>
Pay lots of attention all the time when riding. You do not want to spend hours fixing your bike after a crash when instead you could have payed more attention or gone a little bit slower.
</p>

<h2>Too much clothing</h2>

<p>
This seems to be really common amongst tourers, you do not need multiple sets of clothing! Have the right clothes, not multiples.
</p>

<p>
This is a mistake as it adds a lot of weight and multiple sets of clothing is not necessary. On tour, if it's cold and raining, you should pretty much be wearing all the clothing you have brought with you (the only exception is having one to two pair of spare socks).
</p>

Generally I shoot for three layers of clothing:
<ul>
 <li>Standard ride clothing</li>
 <li>Warmth layers</li>
 <li>Rain gear</li>
</ul>

On a multi-day trip, what you wear is going to get funky, having multiple sets of funky clothing is going to leave you with funky clothing and extra weight. Generally one needs to find clothes that are synthetic or wool, so you can wear them for multiple days and not get too nasty. 

<h2>Too much food</h2>

When travelling on bike, re-supply stops can be really fequent. When setting out, you only need to be prepared for your next resupply. A 5 day trip with re-supply everyday will carry the exact same gear as a 1 day trip. Perhaps the only difference is you'll have a larger repair kit on the 5 day, so instead of 5 tube patches, you might carry 10 or 15 instead.

<h2>Not having repair equipment</h2>

Repair equipment is something that should not be skimped on. The only bad tour is one where you're not moving, not riding. If you get more flats then expected and can't continue, you'll really regret having shed the 100 grams for not carrying an extra tube. When stuck, you'll gladly have traded that 100 grams for being able to continue on.

<h3>Here are some things to be sure to have:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chain break tool</li>
  <li>2 master links for your chain</li>
  <li>If tubeless, 3 spare tubes</li>
  <li>Allen wrenches that will fit every bolt on your bike<li>
  <li>Plenty of tube patches and (if tubeless) tire plugs</li>
  <li>Spare break and shift cable</li>
</ul>

Of course, for anything you bring, be sure you know how to use it!

<h3>Things that are really good to have:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Spare derailleur hangar</li>
  <li>Miniature pliers</li>
</ul>

I once bent a rim wall and need pliers to straighten it out. 

<h2>Too much water</h2>

This one is a smaller mistake and easier to correct (water can be dumped). Generally know how frequently you'll run across water resupply, whether that is a stream where you can filter, or a gas station where you can get water from the soda fountain.

<h2>Buying water</h2>

You don't have to buy water, use the soda fountain at gas stations, or the sink faucets.
